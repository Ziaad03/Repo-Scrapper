Deploying the working backend (Backend/server.js) as a container

Option A — Render (free tier, no credit card for basic apps):
1. Create a Render account (no card required for free services).
2. New -> Web Service -> Connect GitHub repo.
3. Build Command: `npm ci && npm run build` (no build required; you can leave blank)
4. Start Command: `node Backend/server.js`
5. Set Environment Variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` in Render dashboard -> Environment.
6. Deploy. Render will provide a stable URL you can call like `https://<service>.onrender.com/download?owner=...&repo=...&branch=...&id=...`

Option B — Vercel (serverless function) — if `download.js` works after debugging
- Vercel is simpler for serverless but you said `download.js` needs debugging, so container option avoids that.

Local test (Docker):
1. Build: `docker build -t repo-scrapper-backend .`
2. Run: `docker run -p 4000:4000 --env GITHUB_TOKEN=yourtoken repo-scrapper-backend`
3. Test: `curl "http://localhost:4000/download?owner=...&repo=...&branch=...&id=..." --output test.zip`

Notes:
- Container deploy runs the same code as your local `server.js` which you said works.
- If you want me to produce a Render service configuration or help push to Render, I can do that next.
